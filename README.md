# piano-vfx

This is the [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from The Odin Project. I already did the [TOP version](https://github.com/porobertdev/landing-page/) and decided to do something different too, so I tried to remake the webpage of a tool that a friend of my friend made. All credits goes to @internet8, the creator of [piano-vfx](https://www.piano-vfx.com/).
