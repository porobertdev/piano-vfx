# piano-vfx - [Live Preview](https://porobertdev.github.io/piano-vfx/)

This is the [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from The Odin Project. I already did the [TOP version](https://github.com/porobertdev/landing-page/) and decided to do something different too, so I tried to remake the webpage of a tool that a friend of my friend made.

The code might be a mess, but I didn't focus much on keeping it short, and I'm still learning. I tried to use flexbox as much as possible (even over auto margins) to practice what I've learned.
